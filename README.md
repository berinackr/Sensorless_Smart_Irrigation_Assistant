# 🌿 Sensorless Smart Irrigation Assistant

## Background & Achievement  
This project was developed during the **Samsung Innovation Campus Türkiye – Coding and Programming** course.  
It was presented at the final **Hackathon**, where it proudly won **1st Place** among the competing projects. 🎉  

The program is designed to equip participants with **fundamental coding and problem-solving skills**, and this project applied those skills to tackle one of today’s most pressing challenges: **sustainable water management in agriculture**.

## Project Overview  
**Sensorless Smart Irrigation Assistant** is a Python- and web-based application that provides an **optimal irrigation schedule without requiring physical sensors**.  

Instead of costly and maintenance-heavy hardware, the system uses:  
- 🌱 Plant type and growth stages  
- 🌍 Soil type and cultivation environment (field or pot)  
- 📅 Planting date  
- ☀️ Weather forecasts (ET₀ evapotranspiration & rainfall)  

The software calculates a **7-day irrigation program** that helps farmers, gardeners, and hobbyists water their plants effectively while saving water and costs.

## Features  
- Sensorless irrigation recommendations  
- 7-day forecast-based watering schedule  
- Soil water balance model  
- Field and pot cultivation support  
- User-friendly web interface (HTML + Tailwind CSS + JavaScript)  
- Python CLI version for quick use in terminal  
- Low-cost and scalable solution (no sensors required)
